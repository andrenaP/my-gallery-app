# Simple Image Gallery with Pagination

This is a simple image gallery application that allows users to browse through
images, navigate using pagination, and search by name of galleries.

**Features:**

- Displays a collection of images from a JSON data source.
- Provides pagination buttons (next/previous) for easy navigation.
- Includes a dropdown menu for jumping directly to specific pages.
- A search bar allows filtering galleries by name.

**Getting Started:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andrenaP/my-gallery-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Add environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file and fill it. Use `.env.example`

    ```bash
    REACT_APP_Folder="IMG"
    REACT_APP_JsonFolder="Test_output.json"
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

**Data Source:**

The image gallery fetches data from a `output.json` file in the project's
`public` directory. You can update this file with your own image data.

You also need to provide your data in public folder.

**Generating Image Data (JSON):**

To populate the gallery, you'll need to provide image data in JSON format.

You can easily generate this JSON from your folders with images using the
provided `gallery.sh` script. Simply run script on your folders:

```bash
bash gallery.bash
```

This script then generates a valid JSON file (`output.json`) that you can use
with the application.

**Technical Details:**

- **Framework:** React
